      <p>
        Pantelis Roussakis is an Australian web and digital marketing specialist, 
        social media speaker and corporate trainer. I have been a Bitcoin 
        enthusiast for 3 years. 
        <br>
        Crypto currencies have the potential to change the way we transact. I 
        believe that Bitcoin and crypto-currencies per say represent a practical 
        way wealth can created and controlled by individuals. The wide
        acceptance of Bitcoin in Australia will come about when Government and 
        Business groups , can understand and discuss their needs within the new 
        Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin Australia is that place.
        <br>
        I bring my visual communication and marketing skills to Bitcoin Australia 
        so we can create general awareness, educate and update our members and 
        the wider community.
