This is a first post to commemorate the launch of our new site and wiki.

Through the wiki, we hope to create a repository of detailed 
and non-biased information for everyone. The main focus will,
of course, be Bitcoin in Australia.

A wiki login is automatically created for every member of the Association.
The general public may contribute by creating an account and donating
a few bits (as an anti-spam meausre). With these restrictions we hope
to keep the quality of content high.
