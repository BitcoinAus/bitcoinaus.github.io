<h2>Annual General Meeting</h2>
<p>
  The date for the Annual General Meeting (AGM) has not yet been set.
  It is required to occur between 23rd April 2014 and 23rd April 2015.

<h3>Board Elections</h3>
<p>
  Around each AGM a new board is voted in by the Association's membership.
  Any member may self-nominate for a board position.
  No hard and fast details have been set regarding the election.
  It is likely, however, that there will be a nomination period of about
  a month, followed by a voting period of a few weeks, immediately prior
  to the AGM.
